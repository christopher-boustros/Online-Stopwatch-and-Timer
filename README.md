# Stopwatch-and-Timer
A web-based stopwatch and timer application written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. You can run the application on GitHub Pages [**HERE**](https://christopher-boustros.github.io/Stopwatch-and-Timer/)! You can also run the application by cloning this repository on your computer and opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

There are two problems that may be faced when developing a stopwatch/timer. The first is that the numbers displayed on the screen may shake horizontally as they increase/decrease due to the display repeatedly switching from wider to thinner characters. This application solves this problem by using a monospaced font, which is a font whose characters all have equal widths. The second problem is that the time measured by the stopwatch/timer may deviate from the true time after a while if it repeatedly increments/decrements time without verifying the system time. This may happen because there may be delay between each successive incrementation/decrementation of time causing the frequency in which time is incremented/decremented to be non-constant and different from what it is programmed to be. To solve this problem, this application measures time by comparing the current system time to the time when the stopwatch/timer was last started, as opposed to simply incrementing/decrementing the time repeatedly.
